# What is this?
The following is a verbatim copy of Peter Shirley's **Ray Tracing in One Weekend** book (version 3.2.3, 2020-12-07), with the following changes:
 - The language has been changed from C++ to C.
 - All paragraphs expounding upon language-specific properties of the code have been re-written in order to reflect the re-written code in C.
 - Instead of writing image data to *stdout*, the programs in this repo take an additional command line argument specifying a filename. When the programs are run, image data is written to this file. *stdout* is used purely for logging instead.

 The original book in C++ can be read for free [here](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), or can be bought [here](https://www.amazon.de/Tracing-Weekend-Minibooks-Book-English-ebook/dp/B01B5AODD8).

## General remarks
The state of the code as it is in a specific chapter in the book can be found in the directory labeled with the corresponding section number.
